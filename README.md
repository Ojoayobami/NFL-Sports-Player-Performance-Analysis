# NFL-Sports-Player-Performance-Analysis
This project explores the relationship between NFL Combine metrics (like 40-Yard Dash, Bench Press, and Vertical Jump) and career outcomes such as games played, fantasy points, and draft success. Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard that uncovers key insights across players, colleges, conferences, and teams from 1999â€“2013.
