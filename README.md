# üìå Project Title

üèà **NFL Sports & Player Performance Analysis**

## üìå Introduction

The **NFL Sports & Player Performance Analysis** is a comprehensive data analytics study designed to explore how **college performance** and **pre-draft athletic metrics** translate into **NFL career success**.  

By integrating multiple datasets ‚Äî including **NFL Combine results**, **Draft history**, **College statistics**, and **Professional player performance** ‚Äî this project uncovers the data-driven patterns behind what makes an athlete successful in the league.  

The goal is to understand which factors best predict success at the professional level:  
- Do combine metrics like the **40-yard dash**, **bench press**, or **vertical jump** correlate with long-term performance?  
- Which colleges and conferences consistently produce top NFL talent?  
- How do **age, height, weight, and position** influence productivity and fantasy points?  
- Do certain **teams, states, or regions** have higher talent output or better draft efficiency?  

The project combines **statistical analysis**, **visual analytics**, and **predictive insights** to help scouts, analysts, and fans better interpret how early-stage indicators shape a player‚Äôs professional journey.  

The resulting **interactive dashboard** provides a multi-page exploration of the NFL talent pipeline:  
- **Player Performance Overview** ‚Äì Evaluates player productivity, fantasy points, and physical influences.  
- **Combine & Draft Analysis** ‚Äì Examines how combine metrics and draft positions predict career outcomes.  
- **College & Conference Insights** ‚Äì Highlights dominant colleges and conferences shaping the NFL landscape.  
- **Geographic Analysis** ‚Äì Maps where successful players come from and how region impacts player success.  
- **Team & League Performance** ‚Äì Analyzes team efficiency, win rates, and rookie vs. veteran balance.  

Ultimately, this project connects data from **college** and **combine stages** to **career performance outcomes**, offering a data-driven perspective on how **raw athleticism, education, and geography** contribute to success in the NFL.  

## üìÇ Data Collection & Additional Fields

The dataset was provided as part of an academic assignment and was not collected directly by me.
It compiles player, team, draft, and combine data from 1999 onward, covering variables like fantasy points, physical measurements, and college performance indicators.

In addition to the raw fields, numerous derived and calculated fields were created to enrich the analytical depth of the project ‚Äî allowing exploration of year-over-year (YoY) trends, positional comparisons, and team-level insights.

### üí° Purpose of These Calculations

These calculations were designed to:
- Evaluate player development and career growth.  
- Identify college and conference success patterns.  
- Analyze rookie vs. veteran contribution to team performance.  
- Reveal year-over-year (YoY) trends across athletic, draft, and fantasy metrics.  
- Support interactive storytelling through Power BI dashboards.

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preparation

Before analysis, extensive data cleaning and transformation were performed to ensure consistency, accuracy, and usability across datasets covering the years **1999‚Äìpresent**.  

The raw dataset included multiple tables (Player Stats, Combine Results, Draft Data, College Records, and Team Performance). Each table contained missing values, inconsistent naming conventions, and duplicate entries that required preprocessing.

---

### üß≠ Steps Performed

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Data Import & Inspection** | Imported all datasets into Power BI (64-bit) and Excel from provided CSV files. Reviewed column headers, data types, and duplicates. |
| **2. Handling Missing Values** | Replaced or removed null values in key metrics (Height, Weight, 40YD, Bench, Vertical, Fantasy Points). Missing numeric data were replaced with O and metrics (Hometown, HomeState) with Unknown. |
| **3. Data Type Correction** | Converted incorrect data types (e.g., Year as text ‚Üí integer, Fantasy Points as float). |
| **4. Removing Duplicates** | Used player name + year as a composite key to remove repeated records. |
| **5. Standardizing Names** | Cleaned inconsistent player, college, and team names using proper case and text normalization. |
| **6. Derived Fields Creation** | Added new columns like `Age Group`, `HeightBin`, `Career Bin`, and `Player Category` to support analysis. |
| **7. Outlier Detection** | Identified and reviewed extreme values in 40YD, Bench, and Fantasy Points to confirm data validity. |
| **8. Data Merging** | Combined multiple tables (Combine, Draft, and Team Performance) using Player ID and Year as primary keys. |
| **9. Calculated Columns & Measures** | Created DAX measures for YoY changes, averages, and performance ratios to enhance analytical depth. |
| **10. Validation** | Cross-checked totals, averages, and YoY metrics with sample data to ensure calculation accuracy. |
| **11. 64-bit Power BI Memory Fix** | Encountered a model size error in Power BI Desktop (32-bit). Identified that Power Query had automatically added a **‚ÄúChanged Type‚Äù** step during import. Removed that step and **manually redefined column data types** to prevent automatic Int64 conversion. |

---

### üß© Data Transformation Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Excel** | Used for initial cleaning. |
| **Power Query (M Language)** | Applied for data transformation, joins, and normalization. |
| **DAX** | Created custom measures and calculated columns (e.g., YoY%, Ratios, Indexes). |

---

### üß† Outcome

After cleaning and transformation:
- All records were standardized from **1999‚Äìpresent**.  
- Missing and inconsistent values were fixed.  
- 64-bit Power BI resolved prior model crashes caused by data size.  
- New analytical fields (e.g., YoY%, Rookie Contribution, Talent Index) were generated.  
- A unified model connecting **Player ‚Üí College ‚Üí Draft ‚Üí Team ‚Üí Performance** was established for advanced analysis.
